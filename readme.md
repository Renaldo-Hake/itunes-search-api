ITUNES SEARCH API

GOAL:
The aim of this project is to create a full stack application to interact with the itunes search api. The user will be able to search itunes items and also add these items to a list of favorites, the user can also delete from this list of favorites using the item id.

HOW TO USE:
The React app has 2 components to make the application run. 
1. ItunesSearch.js is used to fetch the itunes api data and display it to the user. This data can be filtered in the sence of movies, music etc.
2. CustomApi.js is used to display the list of favorites to the user and also allows the user to delete certain items. 

INSTALATION:
1. Copy this repository
2. From your cmd install node_modules for both the front and backend of the application.
3. cd into the backend and type npm run dev to start up the express app. 
4. On a seperate terminal cd into the frontend and type npm start to start the react app.
5. The app should now be running on your localhost.

SECURITY:
1. In terms of api keys there are no measures taken as there was no need to use api keys.
2. For data security helmet was installed and used on server.js.
